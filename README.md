## About the Engineer
My name is Kaleb Todjo and I am currently a Software Engineer. I take pride in learning both on and outside of my current job. A new passion has been cloud computing specifically with AWS, although I am intersted in learning about other cloud platforms. I currently hold the AWS Certified Cloud Practicioner and AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certifications, this repository contains a portfolio of diverse AWS cloud projects in an effort to build upon the learnings from my certifications to gain new and real-world knowledge.
